# FullStack-Infra-Challenge

## About:
This was a Mini Challenge for creating an REST API and consuming it with a frontend.
With Full CRUD fn.
I used DJANGO REST API framework as the well.. The API and also did two frontends:
1: Using HTML,CSS, Bootstrap and HTMX for a fully dinamic Inline editing table,
using as little JS as possible.
2: A React+MUI+Typescript frontend, not my forte, but ill keep playing with it
in the future, and then remove this comment :).

Fully dockered, and also i added some fixtures to see something in the db.


### To RUN:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
